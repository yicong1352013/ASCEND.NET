    "Description": "I am using Sharp Develop for developing my application. When I try to drop any of these (navigation pane) controls on the designer window, these are getting added in Non-Visual tray where as it is getting added in Visual Tray in Visual Studio. This means I am unable to use these controls in Non-Visual studio environment. Do we have to use VS for using these controls?",
