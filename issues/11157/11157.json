    "Description": "There is something very basic missing in the Outlook navigation pane (and navigationPanePage) and that is the Text property that is kind of standard in all controls.\n \nWhen one places the control on the form with the designer both the pane and the page have some long default name \"navigationPaxxxxxxxxxx\" and there is absolutely no public property that allows one to change that.\n \nThe Page control has a \"Key\" property but that is really very unconventional if that is supposed to be the \"caption\". \n \nThere is no caption property either that could perform this function. I therefore have no way to use this control in my application",
