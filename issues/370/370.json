    "Description": "I need to come up with a better way of doing localization. Currently I have been using the VS resource manager for strings. I need to put this in a satellite assembly so that translations can be done by a non-programmer. I will initially add a dll that uses the VS resource manager that will be called from all other assemblies.",

      "Message": "This one is going to be hard I think.\n\nAll of the tools that I know of read the XML directly. Any reference to a method in a resource file would not be run. It would just show up as text.\n\nI will do some research and see how others may do it.",
