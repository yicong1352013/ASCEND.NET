    "Description": "This is my first post so I apologize if I make mistakes.\nPrevious version of Ascend controls worked well in sharpdevelop 2 both at design and runtime, but with latest version what is missing is the design time appearance.\nIf I drag and drop any Ascend control onto the form the control appears in the component bar...\nIn visual studio 2005 everything works fine.\nthanks in advance.",
