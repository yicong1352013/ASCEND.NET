I would not want or be able to put their code in this project without their permission. (I know this is not what you are suggesting :-)) We have worked hard; as I'm sure they have, to have the project recognition that we have. Maybe if they read this they might want to join this project?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scorn<br />",
