Last week I was thinking how wasteful of resources this is to have the overhead of a panel when all I want is a line. It will use the same render class as the panel so I’m confident of the stability and I think it will be a handy control. It will not delay the release of beta 3.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",
