A custom render on the stock toolbar may be doable but may not be the way to go. I will have to do a proof on concept before I know what can and can’t be done.<br /><br />I’m afraid progress on the controls has slowed considerably in the last 2 months. My day job has expanded to most waking hours in order to meet a deadline. This will be over (I think) by the end of the month and I can get back to what I enjoy, working on the controls. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scorn<br />",
