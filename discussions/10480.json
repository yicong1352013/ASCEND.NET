Then the actual form is completely devoid of logic.<br /><br />As a result you cannot change the captions of the pane and pages unless you modify the .Designer.cs file (bad design practice) and no clear way of seeing how the application reacts to which events.<br />",

I have no grand visions of being able to quit my day job, but a little income would go a long way towards explaining to my budget strapped wife why I work so many hours for free.<br /><br />I’m not saying I won’t be doing any additional controls without donations.
