I have another couple of weeks of long hours on my current project and then things get better.<br /><br />The RC of the current controls should be out by end of day tomorrow. There is just a little testing yet to go.<br /><br />I’ve started on some of the new controls and will have a CTP available late in October. I’m considering doing a nightly or weekly build on the new release. I’m a little worried about breaking changes if I expose daily builds. We strive hard to not have any breaking changes on anything released to the public but in day to day development they happen. I wouldn’t mind some feedback on this from the community.<br /><br />I will get with Martin to see where the German translation stands.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scorn<br />",
