I’m still working on automatically adding the controls and help to Visual Studio. I could add these to the release candidate but I would also like to add the “glass” look to the controls on this version rather than 1.5. The controls we are adding in version 1.5 will take 2 -3 months to get done and I hate to not have this feature for that long.<br /><br />Any opinions on adding an additional beta and delaying the production release for a short bit?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",
