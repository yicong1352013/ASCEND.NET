I'm trying to avoid it as much as possible.<br /><br />I just knew Ascend.net and I'm downloading it. The codeplex.com website is slow as hell. But your software is very promising.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if there's any restriction on using it in my commercial software. I don't mind paying for it as long as it's good. Even if it's free I will make a donation if I made profit from the component.<br /><br />Thanks and keep up the good work.<br />",
