    "Html": "\r\nIn beta 2 we added Deselecting as an event on the NavigationPane. If you attach to this event you can use NavigationPaneCancelEventArgs.Cancel parameter to stop the selected button from becoming current.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />private void navigationPane1_Deselecting(object sender, Ascend.Windows.Forms.NavigationPaneCancelEventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            DialogResult result = MessageBox.Show(this, \"Do you want to change tabs?\", \"Test\", MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Question);<br /><br />            if (result == DialogResult.No)<br />            {<br />                e.Cancel = true;<br /><br />            }<br /><br />        }<br /><br />You could also just do any actions required for the currently focused button in this event before the new button is set as current and not cancel.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn <br />",
