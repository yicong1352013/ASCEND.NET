I was wondering if anything has developed on this front.<br /><br />Keep up the good work. I will definately use these in the future projects I do on 05..<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Husain<br />",

It makes more sense to finish the controls and then do a back port to 1.1. If we try to support both in the same code base Iâ€™m afraid it will bring development to a crawl. I do think at least for the moment we would have a larger user base if we supported 1.1. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",
