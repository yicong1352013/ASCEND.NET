Please continue your great work.<br /><br /><br />What I constantly need (and miss) are a docking extension and a grid (similar to Outlook 2003).<br /><br />I've searched the internet a lot and the best solution for docking I've found is the DockPanel by Weifen Luo (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite).<br /><br />An interesting implementation of a grid control can be found here http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/OutlookGrid.asp.<br /><br />If these controls could be added the Ascent control collection would blast everything else.<br /><br />Greetz to all, Metal-Frog<br />",

We need the Tab control that is being worked on now to get it done.<br /><br />Several members have been looking at an Outlook like grid. It’s not on the list yet but I’m sure it will be.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scorn<br />",
