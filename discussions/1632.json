I re-posted the install with this fix in place at 9:45 AM U.S. central time (15:45 GMT). About 55 has downloaded before this  post. The bug does correct it’s self but it was very visible and I didn’t want to leave it this way. Sorry for the issue. If you have downloaded and want this fix please download and install again.<br /><br />Scorn<br />",
