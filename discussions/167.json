Earlier version of the controls worked for the most part in SharpDevelop but had a few design issues. I’m not sure if it was the fact that SharpDevelop 2 was a beta or an issue with the control. If anyone is interested in working with SharpDevelop or another IDE and the controls I think it would be a good idea.<br />",
