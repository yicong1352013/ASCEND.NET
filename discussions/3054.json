I had a similar one that I solved by using my own scroller and adding this :<br /><br />void CustomScrollbar1_Scroll(object customScroller, CustomControls.CustomScrollEventArgs e)<br />        {<br />            SendMessage(toolbox1.Handle, WM_SETREDRAW, Convert.ToInt32(false), 0);<br />            panel1.AutoScrollPosition = e.NewValue;<br />            SendMessage(toolbox1.Handle, WM_SETREDRAW, Convert.ToInt32(true), 0);<br />            toolbox1.Invalidate(toolbox1.DisplayRectangle, true);<br />        }<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.codeplex.com/ASCENDNET/Wiki/View.aspx?title=DllImport%28%22user32.dll%22%2c%20CharSet%20%3d%20CharSet.Auto%29\">DllImport(\"user32.dll\", CharSet = CharSet.Auto)</a><br />private static extern IntPtr SendMessage(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 msg, Int32 wParam, Int32 lParam);<br />private const int WM_SETREDRAW = 0xB;<br /><br />This produces flickerfree drawing. I have used it extensively using static background images without a problem. I don't know how you could embed it in your suite but it's a neat trick nevertheless. I ported it from a C++ example from here http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/controls/listbox/colorlistboxes/article.php/c10413/<br />",

It involves using one extra panel and one more custom control (or a panel) in your custom control. <br /><br />Here is the link:<br />http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/customscrollbar.asp<br /><br />While the guy who wrote it uses it to make his own scrollbar, you could change it and include a standard .NET scrollbar, or maybe a ASCEND.NET.GradientScrollbar?? :-)<br /><br />You will only have to implement some designer functionality, so the whole 2 extra panels thing will be transparent to the user.<br /><br />Let me know if it works<br />",
