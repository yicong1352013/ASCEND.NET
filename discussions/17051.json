Inasmuch as I have a couple on top of each other I can't get to the covered ones because I can't select the topmost one and do a send to back. I can select them in the Properties window and change info about the panels, and they draw fine when compiled. But I can't do any visual editing of items below the topmost Ascend panel.<br />",
