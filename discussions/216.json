They do not AllowPartiallyTrustedCallers. To do the security correctly this forces the action list classes into another assembly. (Ascend.Design) This is how Microsoft does it also.<br /><br />The problem this causes is the design assembly must be referenced by the controls (Ascend.Windows.Forms) and the controls must be referenced in the design assembly.<br />A circular reference...Ack<br /><br />To allow the circular reference to compile normally in Visual Studio all assembly references except those in Ascend.Windows.Forms are referenced directly from the GAC.<br /><br />To do your initial compile drag the 4 assemblies in Solution Items into the assembly directory under your Windows directory. Once this is done you can compile as normal.<br /><br />I need to look into MSBuild rules a little moreâ€¦<br /><br />Thanks<br />",
