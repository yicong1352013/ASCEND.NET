I like to use it as sort of a static, but slick looking, divider bar.<br /><br />Is there anyway I can help out?  My background lies heavily in desktop applications so I really enjoy building custom controls from scratch as well as enhancing the design-time experience of older custom controls.  I'd be willing to help out wherever I could be of use, though.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Jeremy<br />",
