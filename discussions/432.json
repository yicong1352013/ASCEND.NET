Also include where you are located in the world. It doesn’t matter where you are but it helps to know for project communications.<br /><br />I’ve not received a couple of emails that I’ve sent to this account so if you do not receive a response after a few days please try again. I respond to all requests to join the project.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",
