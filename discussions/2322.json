The current one only allows for left justified title text and that text is only one color (Blue). So if one is using a GradientPanel and makes the colors dark...then drops a groupbox on it, the title text is washed out....grrr. Here is my recommendation:<br /><br />A group box that does the following things<br /><br />   1) Works well as a container for Ascend's controls.<br />   2) Title text font and color could be specified.<br />   3) Position of title text could be Left, Right and centered.<br />   4) Text could appear on any of the axis of the box in definable alignment.<br />   5) Gradient caption could be used as the Title text.<br /><br />Just my thoughts. <br /><br />advTHANKSance<br />",
