This CTP will have all the version 1.5 controls available. The first beta will be mid January with a production release around the end of February.  Version 2 will start shortly after that. Unfortunately all these dates are relative to my day jobs work load.  Iâ€™m hoping my work load will be much lower than it has been for the last three months.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scott<br />",
