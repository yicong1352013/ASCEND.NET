This will be allowed in the NavigationPane in beta 2.<br /><br />The question I have is if the RightToLeft property is set to true in a control should any text alignment you have set be overridden and automatically be set to right center?<br /><br />The reason I ask this is the caption, footer and each individual button on a NavigationPane may have their text alignment set independently in beta 2. If you set RightToLeft to true any independent text alignment you have done will be set to right center. <br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",

Basically if set to true a right alignment of the text will actually be left and left alignment will be right. I’ve always found this more confusing than just setting the alignment but I think it is best to match what Microsoft has already done.<br />",
