I really love your controls.<br />But meanwhile I've switched to the Krypton Toolkit (<a href=\"www.componentfactory.com\" class=\"externalLink\">www.componentfactory.com<span class=\"externalLinkIcon\" style=\"font-family:Consolas, Courier New, Courier, Monospace;\"></span></a>) which is free and really, really great. It will be hard work for you to beat these controls. The Krypton Toolkit is a complete suite to create Office 2007 style applications. They also sell a ribbon for a low fee.<br />If you can manage to implement the same functionality I'll be with you again. Maybe I can support you with a few additional controls.<br /><br />Kind regards, Tom<br />",
