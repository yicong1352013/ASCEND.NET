Here is the source code.<br /><br />ColorMatrix colorMatrix = new ColorMatrix();<br />colorMatrix.Matrix33 = (this.Alpha / 255.0f); //33 is alpha<br /><br />ImageAttributes imageAttributes = new ImageAttributes();<br /><br />â€¦<br /><br />imageAttributes.SetColorMatrix(colorMatrix);<br /><br />It is in GradientCaptionRender.cs in the public override void Render(System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs e) method. I figure their must be another setting in the color matrix that needs to be set but ColorMatrix is not well documented.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />scorn<br />",
