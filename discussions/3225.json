My power supply burned up and took much of the attached hardware with it. (Think loud electric buzzing and blue flames) Those of you that know me know that I have several children and December and its holidays make for a very expensive month. Not a time of the year to be buying new hardware for myself. I’ve always been a pack rat when it comes to old hardware much to wife’s aggravation. I was able to cobble together a system from old parts. It’s not pretty or fast but at least I’m going again and I have some small justification for why I hang on to old hardware. :-) Maybe later this year I can look into building a basic Vista system.<br /><br />I have the tab working at a very basic level. It currently only supports square tabs and does not yet support multiple tab lines. I hope to get all this done by the end of the week. I will start on the ExplorerPane control after that. <br /><br />Scott<br />",
