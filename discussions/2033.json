My code is<br /><br />Ascend.Windows.Forms.GradientBackgroundRender rnd = new Ascend.Windows.Forms.GradientBackgroundRender();<br />rnd.CornerRadius = new Ascend.CornerRadius(5);<br />rnd.RenderMode = Ascend.Windows.Forms.RenderMode.Glass;<br />rnd.AntiAlias = true;<br />rnd.GradientLowColor = SystemColors.InactiveCaption;<br />rnd.GradientHighColor = SystemColors.Window;<br />rnd.Render(new PaintEventArgs(e.Graphics, e.Bounds));<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't render anything - the docs don't explain much here, but maybe one of you can help out?<br /><br />Thanks in advance, <br /><br />Phil<br />",

I had it checked off on my housekeeping document but apparently didn’t remove it.<br /><br />What you need to use is GradientBackgroundRender and set the RenderMode property to RenderMode.Glass. This will result in a glass render based on your properties. There is little difference in how a regular gradient render and a glass render is done internally and it ran far faster in a single class.<br /><br />Sorry for the confusion.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scorn<br />",
