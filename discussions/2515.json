I also have a command manager that ties the edit controls to the UI and actions that I would like to improve.<br /><br />The next phase of my current project also needs tablet functionality in the edit controls. Maybe I can tie it all together as a set of controls. As always the time to get the controls to level of completeness so that they can be released to an international user base of different skill levels is the only real question.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Scott<br /><br /><br /><br />",
